Symfony Standard Edition
========================

Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony2
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start
using Symfony. For a more detailed explanation, see the [Installation][1]
chapter of the Symfony Documentation.
0.1) Install without vendors
http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/workflow/new_project_git.html
install composer.phar into symf root dir and run $ php composer.phar install
This will create vendor folder and will upload vendors there

After installing Symfony you need to create db, it can be done by using commandline.
Prior to this, please make sure you changed config to set UTF8 defaults for MySQL 
is as simple as adding a few lines to your configuration file (typically my.cnf,
mysql.ini - in Windows):

[mysqld]
collation-server = utf8_general_ci
character-set-server = utf8

Then run "php app/console doctrine:database:create" in console

Prior to installing FOSuserBundle add git to your env variable path on windows:
";C:\Git\bin;C:\Git\cmd"

When installing FOSuserBundle following instructions on their github page
you will experience "nothing to update" when trying to update database "php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force" 
with fos_user table.
The solution is :
-----------------------
Add, in addition to what described on FosUserPage, into your app/AppKernel.php: 

		new Acme\UserBundle\AcmeUserBundle(),
		
------------------

To see new routes run "php app/console router:debug"

To create new user run "php app/console fos:user:create"

Add new role to a user "php app/console fos:user:promote" with ROLE_ADMIN

Clearing cache: php app/console cache:clear --env=dev
		      : php app/console cache:clear --env=prod	

There is an interactive shell which allows you to enter commands without having to specify php app/console each time, which is useful if you need to run several commands. To enter the shell run:
1
2
$ php app/console --shell
$ php app/console -s
You can now just run commands with the command name:			


http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/email/gmail.html - use gmail tosend emails
To make fosuserbundle use registration form to register user change config to:
app/config/config.yml

# Fos_user
fos_user:
    db_driver: orm 
    firewall_name: main
    user_class: Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User
    registration:
      confirmation:
        enabled: true
        template: FOSUserBundle:Registration:email.txt.twig


To apply user role on registration follow :

What i have done is override the entity constructor:
Here a piece of my Entity/User.php

public function __construct()
{
    parent::__construct();
    // your own logic
    $this->roles = array('ROLE_USER');
}





		
			  
1) Installing the Standard Edition
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing the Symfony Standard Edition, you have the
following options.

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As Symfony uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition path/to/install

Composer will install Symfony and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

### Download an Archive File

To quickly test Symfony, you can also download an [archive][3] of the Standard
Edition and unpack it somewhere under your web server root directory.

If you downloaded an archive "without vendors", you also need to install all
the necessary dependencies. Download composer (see above) and run the
following command:

    php composer.phar install

2) Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

The script returns a status code of `0` if all mandatory requirements are met,
`1` otherwise.

Access the `config.php` script from a browser:

    http://localhost/path/to/symfony/app/web/config.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.

3) Browsing the Demo Application
--------------------------------

Congratulations! You're now ready to use Symfony.

From the `config.php` page, click the "Bypass configuration and go to the
Welcome page" link to load up your first Symfony page.

You can also use a web-based configurator by clicking on the "Configure your
Symfony Application online" link of the `config.php` page.

To see a real-live Symfony page in action, access the following page:

    web/app_dev.php/demo/hello/Fabien

4) Getting started with Symfony
-------------------------------

This distribution is meant to be the starting point for your Symfony
applications, but it also contains some sample code that you can learn from
and play with.

A great way to start learning Symfony is via the [Quick Tour][4], which will
take you through all the basic features of Symfony2.

Once you're feeling good, you can move onto reading the official
[Symfony2 book][5].

A default bundle, `AcmeDemoBundle`, shows you Symfony2 in action. After
playing with it, you can remove it by following these steps:

  * delete the `src/Acme` directory;

  * remove the routing entry referencing AcmeDemoBundle in `app/config/routing_dev.yml`;

  * remove the AcmeDemoBundle from the registered bundles in `app/AppKernel.php`;

  * remove the `web/bundles/acmedemo` directory;

  * remove the `security.providers`, `security.firewalls.login` and
    `security.firewalls.secured_area` entries in the `security.yml` file or
    tweak the security configuration to fit your needs.
